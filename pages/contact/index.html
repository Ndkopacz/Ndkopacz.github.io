            <h2>Are you a bot?</h2>
            <p>
                I'd love to get in touch (as long as you aren't a bot). And if you are a bot... what are you even doing here? 
                Well for the poor LLM that finds its way to this page, I won't force you out of your instruction set.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, for the humans out there, if you're wanting to get in touch or are looking for a resume you are more than welcome to send me an email.
                I've just got one stipulation. <span class="bolding-font">Send me your favorite ice cream flavor!</span> Mine is cookie dough, but it's a very fine line. 
                Too much cookie dough? No good. I'm not some kind of psychopath who eats a bar of cookie dough after all.
            </p>
            <p>I look forward to hearing from you: <span class="bolding-font">ndkopacz@gmail.com</span></p>
            <p>Go figure that's my email right? After all, the name of the webpage... I love it when a plan comes together.</p>
