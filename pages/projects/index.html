                <h2>Launch Land Recharge Drone</h2>
                <p>
                    The Launch Land Recharge (LLR) Drone project aims to develop an autonomously operated drone system that can launch, 
                    land, and recharge on a docking station. This drone will play a key role in larger fully autonomous drone systems, 
                    providing crucial functionality for rapid deployment in critical environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The core feature of the LLR drone is its ability to autonomously locate and return to a docking station, using 
                    vision processing to detect April Tags and determine its relative local coordinates. This allows the drone to 
                    precisely land on the charging pad after completing its mission, ensuring it is always mission-ready. A fully 
                    3D-printed body and docking station will encapsulate all key components, offering a lightweight, customized 
                    solution tailored to the project's requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The drone will support both manual and computer-controlled operation, offering flexibility for a variety of 
                    use cases such as disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and public safety. With robust April Tag 
                    detection and processing, it will autonomously hover, land, and launch, making it an integral piece of future 
                    automated drone systems.
                </p>

                <h2>Autonomous Deterrent and Alert Module</h2>
                <p>
                    ADAM is an edge device designed to monitor a camera feed, autonomously deploy deterrents, 
                    and function as a video doorbell. Its primary role is to provide security by allowing users 
                    to monitor and communicate through the device, with a secondary function of autonomously 
                    activating a deterrent if necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key features of ADAM include a 3D-printed housing for all components, a wired connection 
                    to power, and wireless communication to a network. The device is self-hosted, offering a 
                    web interface for users to view the camera feed, enable or disable autonomous deterrent 
                    capabilities, and manually activate deterrents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system employs a neural network (NN) to detect specific targets, such as individuals 
                    wearing a red hat, and communicates these detections to the website for logging and further 
                    action. Users can control deterrent features, and future iterations will enhance functionality 
                    by integrating audio streaming, alarm sounds, facial recognition, and additional security 
                    layers such as police deterrent lockout features.
                </p>
