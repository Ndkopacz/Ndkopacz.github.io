            <h2>Professional Experience - Northrop Grumman</h2>
            <p>
                I have been an intern with Northrop Grumman for the past three summers, where I gained extensive experience in software development, 
                machine learning, and hardware management. In my first summer (2022), I joined an agile development team where I quickly adapted to a 
                complex software baseline. I took on various tasks, such as implementing new features and developing machine learning algorithms. 
                During this time, I also created thorough documentation for machine learning implementations and run instructions to ensure the 
                reproducibility of my work. Additionally, I developed a web scraping script to tag an airplane ADS-B dataset, which was later 
                used in further machine learning processes. A key achievement from this period was training a convolutional neural network to identify 
                unique hardware fingerprints of transceivers. Enabled by an incredible technical manager and a tight-knit team, I was honored to receive 
                Northrop Grumman's New Technology Award in the summer of 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my second summer (2023), I worked in a cleared environment, where I had the opportunity to contribute to simulations 
                of various satellite architectures using AFSIM. Due to the classified nature of the work, I am unable to go into specifics, 
                but this experience allowed me to expand my knowledge in system simulations and satellite architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my third summer (2024), I assumed ownership of several key hardware assets, including drones, communication systems, batteries, and 3D printers. 
                I successfully completed a project involving image-based geolocation through the use of an AI-driven automatic target recognition system. Additionally, 
                I led the migration of our software from ROS1 to ROS2 and implemented a Kalman filter-based system to improve target tracking predictions. Over the summer, 
                I also participated in three "fly days," where our team conducted live demonstrations of our code for autonomous target detection and geolocation, showcasing 
                the real-world applications of our work.
